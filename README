packETH-1.8 (C) 2003-2014 by Miha Jemec, <jemcek@gmail.com>
Covered under the GPL.


USAGE:

The usage of the program should be pretty straightforward. As you will see, there are 4 main windows (first four buttons from the left side). I call them:
- Builder - the page where you build the packet and send it once
- Gen-b - generator for sending multiple number of packet currently build inside Builder
- Gen-s - generator that allows you to select up to 10 previosly built packets and send them in different manner
- Pcap window - open a tcpdump/wireshark capture file and put the selected packet into builder

To send the packets you need the SuperUser rights.

CLI version:
Inside cli subdirectory you can find also the command line version of packETH called packETHcli. Just type "make" inside the subdir. 

Type ./packETHcli -h  for more options.

More information you can find on the packETH homepage: http://http://packeth.sourceforge.net/packeth/Home.html

If you get into problems, please feel free to contact me.
